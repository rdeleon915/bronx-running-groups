          As schools reopen and indoor dining tentatively resumes, running groups in the Bronx have also started meeting again for the first time during the pandemic.
          Bronx Sole was the first to return in August with strict parameters to ensure their members’ safety, which other groups have also followed closely.
          <br>
          <br> “We want to make sure that we continue engaging with the community and inspiring others to join at whatever capacity they can join us,” says Amy Ortiz, 36, co-founder of Bronx Femme Run. For them, she says, the most important thing is
          “running where people don’t see runners.”
          <br>
          <br> Bronx Sole and Bronx Femme Run are just two of many initiatives in the borough allowing residents to take back control of their own health during the COVID-19 pandemic. With more time available, more people are picking up exercising as
          the quarantine progresses.

          36% of runners reported exercising more often and 73% of runners wanted to continue running after the pandemic ends.
          <br> 79% of those surveyed said running helps them feel “saner” and “more in control,” and 65% of them said it provided more mental benefits than any other physical exercise

          While running is less popular on Zwift than cycling, they also noted a <b> six-time increase </b> in the number of running miles logged daily.
          <br> The New York Times recently reported on data from Strava Metro that showed that biking has increased by <b>147%</b> among women and <b>68%</b> among men.

          <br> “I feel like I'm the least athletic person on the earth,” says Milagros Ramirez, 40. “It really is motivating to do it with other people.” Ramirez just recently joined Bronx Sole’s run-walk group after picking up running as a way to
          combat anxiety and depression during the pandemic.
          <br>
          <br> “I'm not completely out of my anxiety and depression. I'm really not,” says Ramirez. “But I think when I do go and run a little bit, I feel myself a little bit stronger.”
          <br>
          <br> Justin Mashia, 38, co-founded Bronx Sole after discovering that the Bronx was once again ranked as the unhealthiest county in New York State. The borough has consistently ranked last across
          multiple categories in an annual report from the County Health Rankings, while Manhattan often ranked amongst the
          healthiest. These issues are further confounded with the impact that COVID-19 has had on the borough.

          <br>The Bronx has had 53,617 coronavirus cases, which accounts for <b>21.5%</b> of the total cases in New York City.
          <br> The borough also made up <b>20.7%</b> of the total deaths in New York City.

          In accordance with CDC regulations for social distancing, these Bronx running groups reduced the size of their meets and have participants sign up ahead of time online. Members are also required to maintain social
          distancing and keep their masks on during runs.
          <br>
          <br> “We take all the precautions and we wear a mask,” says south Bronx teacher Jardy Santana, who runs with Bronx Femme Run. “I feel really safe because these are people that I know already for months… I know if someone's not feeling well,
          they're not going to show up.”
